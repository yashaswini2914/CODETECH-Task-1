Overview of the Project
Project Name:
Password Strength Checker
A Password Strength Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the strength of a user's password and provide feedback on how secure it is. This project is commonly implemented to enhance security by encouraging users to create stronger, more secure passwords.

Key Components of the Project:
User Input: The user enters a password, which will be analyzed by the system.

Password Criteria: The password is evaluated based on specific security criteria such as:

Length: A strong password is typically longer, e.g., 12+ characters.
Character Variety: A mix of:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special characters (e.g., @, #, $, etc.)
Common Passwords: Checking whether the password is on a list of commonly used or compromised passwords.
Repetition: Avoiding repeated characters or patterns.
Strength Evaluation: Based on the criteria, the password is categorized as:

Weak: Fails multiple criteria (e.g., too short, contains common words).
Moderate: Meets some criteria but lacks certain elements.
Strong: Meets all criteria and is hard to guess or crack.
Feedback System: The system provides feedback to the user, such as:

Encouraging the use of more varied characters.
Suggesting longer passwords.
Warning against using dictionary words or common phrases.
Real-Time Analysis (Optional): Some password strength checkers provide real-time feedback as the user types their password.

Technologies to Implement:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for real-time feedback on password strength.
Backend: Python, Node.js, or other server-side technologies for additional analysis.
Libraries: JavaScript libraries like zxcvbn (a password strength estimator) or custom algorithms for evaluating password complexity.
 Features:
Security Tips: Recommendations for stronger password creation.
Password History Check: Warn if the user has reused old passwords (in systems with authentication).
Integration with Signup Forms: Commonly integrated with registration or password-reset forms.
Real-World Use Cases:
Ensuring strong password practices in web applications.
Enhancing security protocols for personal accounts.
Educating users on good password hygiene.
